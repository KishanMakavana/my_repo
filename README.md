## Q.1. Identify FRs and NFRs:

The institute has been recently set up to provide state-of-the-art research facilities in the
field of Software Engineering. Apart from research scholars (students) and professors, it also
includes quite a large number of employees who work on different projects undertaken by
the institution.

As the size and capacity of the institute is increasing with the time, it has been proposed to
develop a Library Information System (LIS) for the benefit of students and employees of the
institute. LIS will enable the members to borrow a book (or return it) with ease while sitting
at his desk/chamber. The system also enables a member to extend the date of his borrowing
if no other booking for that particular book has been made. For the library staff, this system
aids them to easily handle day-to-day book transactions. The librarian, who has
administrative privileges and complete control over the system, can enter a new record into
the system when a new book has been purchased, or remove a record in case any book is
taken off the shelf. Any non-member is free to use this system to browse/search books
online. However, issuing or returning books is restricted to valid users (members) of LIS only.
The final deliverable would be a web application (using the recent HTML 5), which should
run only within the institute LAN. Although this reduces security risk of the software to a
large extent, care should be taken no confidential information (eg., passwords) is stored in
plain text.


### Functional Requirements:
1) Member should able to borrow a book online.
2) Member should able to return a book online.
3) Member should able to extend the deadline. 
4) librarian has privileges and complete control over the system.
5) librarian should able to add new purchesed book and its record in system.
6) librarian should able to remove book and its record in case any book taken off in system.
7) any non-member should able to search books online.
8) library staff should able to see transaction history.
1) System should able to maintain member operational data.

### Non-Functional Requirements:
1) System should be secure so that non-member can't do borrowing.
2) System should have large capacity to store required records of book because of large number books and  member.
3) System should able to respons back quickly to any requisted operation.
4) System should able be to maintain its performance when large number of member are using System.
5) System should able to within institute LAN only. 
6) System should recover quickly after disaster.


## Q.2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.
Approximately 5% of the world population (or a staggering 466 million people) suffers from
disabling hearing loss. We set out to create an impactful solution for this community that
addresses some of their everyday needs. Our mobile application uses artificial intelligence to
recognize key sound events of interest to this community, such as car horns and babies,
where immediate alerts and continual logging are critical for the user. This app is optimized
for Android with low-latency so that it works in real-time for use.

### scope : 
1) it works on android device.
2) artificial intelligence 
3) The application involves use of AI.

### features :
1) user should be able to  track daily activity in The System.
2) Application should be available to use at any time and 
3) The sound that are available in app should be voice voice controlled.
4) User should be able logged in using authentication.


### Non-Functional Requirements:
1) System should work sound very accuretly.
2) System should have very low-latency in alert.
3) Any emergency circumtance should not generate System crash.
4) User interface should as less comples as possible
5) Application should be able to maintain privecy.
